## Multiple Linear Regression
Vehicle length and ground clearance help explain some of the mpg variance evident by very small p-values.  The small p-value suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis and say with sufficient evidence that the slope of the linear model is not zero.  Multiple R-squared is above 0.7 so it is evident that this linear model does a good job helping us predict what is happening in our current dataset.  However, AWD and spoiler_angle do not really help so we may have an overfitting problem.  It is worth finding more siginficant variables if possible since we may not be able to generalize this dataset to forecast appropriately. 
## Summarize Suspension Data
Out of all 3 lots, only Lot 3 exceeds a 100 PSI variance, which is above specification.  Across all lots, PSI is under 100.
